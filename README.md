Apologies for this poorly formatted readMe

Folders/Files
Problems- toy problems (without answers), I'm collecting from various sources
TD Answers - my work in progress on solving those toy problems, feel free to add a folder for yourself. Just copy the problems from
  the Problems directory. I use an html file to debug toy problems in browser. Also have a file to record my own progress but it 
  could use formatting help
template.html - if you make an answer folder, make a copy of this template and link your files if you want to use the browser console
otherProjects - links and descriptions of other learning tools, anyone can edit
